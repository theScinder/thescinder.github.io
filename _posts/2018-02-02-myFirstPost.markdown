I am trying out Jekyll with Github pages. This is only slightly modified from the automatic post generated by Jekyll


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def printHello():
  print("Hello. This is a test of code highlighting with Jekyll")
  return

{% endhighlight %}

Switching to Jekyll is mainly inspired by blog posts from [Ian Goodfellow][ian-goodfellow] and [Andrej Karpathy.][andrej-karpathy] 

My main blog is still at [www.thescinder.com][the-scinder] but I plan to start posting here soon.
